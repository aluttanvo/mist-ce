Al Qamus Al Muhith was first printed in 1352-1354 (1933-1935 CE) in Cairo, Egypt. Since then, it has been reprinted several times and has become a standard reference for Arabic students and researchers. However, due to its large size and complex layout, it is not easily accessible to everyone. Fortunately, thanks to the efforts of digital libraries and archives, such as the Internet Archive and the Digital Library of India, Al Qamus Al Muhith is now available online in PDF format for free download[^1^] [^2^]. This allows anyone interested in learning more about the richness and diversity of the Arabic language to access this valuable resource.
 
Al Qamus Al Muhith is not only a dictionary, but also a treasure of Arabic culture and civilization. It reflects the knowledge and achievements of the Islamic golden age in various fields, such as religion, philosophy, literature, history, geography, astronomy, medicine, and mathematics. It also preserves the linguistic heritage of the Arabs and their interactions with other nations and languages. Al Qamus Al Muhith is a testament to the genius and creativity of Al Firozabadi and his contribution to the Arabic language.
  
Al Firozabadi was not only a lexicographer, but also a scholar of various disciplines, such as grammar, rhetoric, literature, history, and jurisprudence. He wrote many books and treatises on these subjects, some of which are still extant and studied today. For example, he wrote Al-Bulghah fi Tarikh A'immat al-Lughah (The Eloquence in the Biography of the Masters of Language), a biographical dictionary of Arabic linguists and grammarians. He also wrote commentaries on the Quran, the Hadith, and some classical works of Arabic literature.
 
Al Firozabadi was also a devout Muslim and a follower of the Shafi'i school of law. He was influenced by the teachings of Sufism, especially by the works of Ibn Arabi, whom he praised in his poems. He was known for his piety, generosity, and humility. He used to teach at his house in Mecca, where he also hosted many scholars and students from different regions. He was respected and honored by many rulers and dignitaries, such as Timur, who visited him in Shiraz and offered him gifts and privileges.
 
Al Firozabadi died in 1414 in Zabid, Yemen, where he was buried. His death was mourned by many people who admired his knowledge and virtues. His legacy lives on through his works, especially his dictionary Al Qamus Al Muhith, which remains a valuable source of information and inspiration for anyone interested in the Arabic language and culture.
